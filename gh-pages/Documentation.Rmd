## Documentation
- The data set was gotten from kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-india).
- The googlevis motion chart allows you to visualise the COVID-19 situation in India states.
- Select a state and view the motion chart corresponding to the state on the right. 
- You can set x to positive, negative, total samples tested (all are cumulative), time
 & more and so is the case with y, color and size.
- For instance, set x to time and y and color to positive and size to total samples tested to view how, for that particular state in India, the number of COVID-19 cases has grown/shrink with time.
